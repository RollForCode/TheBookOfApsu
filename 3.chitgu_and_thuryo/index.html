  <h1>3.chitgu and thuryo</h1>

<h2 id="the-book-of-chitgu-and-thuryo">The Book of Chitgu and Thuryo</h2>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> In the days of silence before dawn, two children were brought to the gates of the Cloister. One was Chitgu, a young orc, wild and untempered, found by an Outreach who had hunted an evil wyrm that had laid waste to her village and left her an orphan. The other was Thuryo, a child born into mystery, discovered swaddled and sleeping upon the steps of the Cloister’s grand hall. The elders took them in, for they saw in these two a spark of purpose, and they knew that Apsu’s path would be made known through them. </p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Chitgu grew in strength and resilience, his arms and heart hardened by training. The fires of rage he carried as a child grew cool and focused, honed by years of sparring, lifting, and enduring. Thuryo, in turn, found his mind as sharp as the morning wind, his fingers nimbly weaving arcane symbols, his eyes bright with the light of hidden knowledge. As they trained side by side, their bond deepened, for they were as scales upon the same dragon’s skin, separate yet whole.</p>
<h3 id="the-parable-of-the-egg-and-the-taste-of-apsus-blessing">The Parable of the Egg and the Taste of Apsu’s Blessing</h3>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> One dawn, as the children rose from their cots, the smell of roasting eggs filled the air. Chitgu turned to Thuryo, his brow furrowed, for he had heard tales that the taking of eggs was forbidden in some far lands. He pondered aloud: “Why, then, does the Cloister allow the tasting of the unborn, if Apsu treasures all things?” </p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> The elder, overhearing their confusion, spoke with a warm smile: “It is not the egg itself that Apsu has blessed, but the sharing of it. Apsu watches over all life, yet he teaches us that the simplest things of the earth are not withheld from us.”  </p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> And he told them this tale:<br />
In the days of the first followers, a young Outreach found herself lost in a barren land, hungry and cold. As she wandered, she came upon a single egg lying beneath a great tree. She knelt, pondering whether to take it, and in her hunger she prayed, asking Apsu, <em>“If I eat this egg, do I steal from life itself?”</em>  </p>
<p><strong>3.6</strong> And Apsu answered her in a whisper carried on the breeze: <em>“The earth and all its gifts are given to my faithful, not to hoard, but to share. Taste it, my child, and know that when you hunger, I provide.”</em> </p>
<p><strong>3.7</strong> The elder continued, “Thus, the taste of eggs is a reminder of Apsu’s abundance, and in every meal we share, we honor his blessing.”  </p>
<p><strong>3.8</strong> Chitgu and Thuryo pondered this, understanding that the taking of food, when done in respect and with the intent to share, was an act of gratitude to Apsu.</p>
<h3 id="the-tale-of-rugs-and-the-hearth-of-fellowship">The Tale of Rugs and the Hearth of Fellowship</h3>
<p><strong>3.9</strong> In their third year at the Cloister, Chitgu and Thuryo were sent to the town of Durnvale to learn the ways of trade and conversation, for even warriors must know the world outside. Upon entering the pub where they were to stay, Chitgu was startled to see the floor covered in rugs of every kind: great woven mats, patched and frayed, colored and worn by the steps of countless travelers.  </p>
<p><strong>3.10</strong> Thuryo, puzzled, asked the tavern-keeper, “Why is it that rugs cover the floors here, and not fine wood or stone?” The tavern-keeper laughed and offered them seats, inviting them to take off their boots and sit upon the rugs, feeling the warmth and comfort beneath them. </p>
<p><strong>3.11</strong> That night, the elder told them the tale of Apsu’s blessing upon rugs:<br />
Long ago, an Outreach came upon a village on the brink of division. The people there argued over the floor of their meeting hall—some wished for hard stone, others for polished wood. As tempers flared, the Outreach prayed to Apsu, asking how best to bring peace.  </p>
<p><strong>3.12</strong> That night, Apsu appeared to him in a dream, saying, <em>“The hard floor will divide; the woven rug will unite. For as my followers walk many paths, so too should the floor of fellowship carry the marks of many lives. Let the rugs lie, that no one man’s step be greater than another’s.”</em>  </p>
<p><strong>3.13</strong> Thus, the Outreach laid down rugs of all kinds, gifted from villagers and travelers alike. And from that day forward, the pub became a place of gathering and warmth, a home to all who entered, with no one above another. </p>
<p><strong>3.14</strong> The elder looked at Chitgu and Thuryo with wisdom in his eyes and said, “Remember, children: where there is warmth, there is welcome. Apsu teaches that all who walk should walk upon the same path, woven together.”</p>
<h3 id="the-tale-of-ale-and-the-cheer-of-the-faithful">The Tale of Ale and the Cheer of the Faithful</h3>
<p><strong>3.15</strong> When they grew older, Chitgu and Thuryo were taught the ways of celebration and rest, for Apsu does not ask his followers to go without joy. One evening, they gathered with their fellow students, their cups filled with foaming ale. Thuryo, hesitant, asked, “Does Apsu approve of this cheer? Should we, who are his faithful, be solemn always?”  </p>
<p><strong>3.16</strong> The elder, who had heard this question many times, smiled and told the tale of the first feast:<br />
In the earliest days, a solemn Outreach wandered far, heavy with the burden of his task. He sought to do only what was solemn and just, denying himself food and laughter. One night, as he camped by the river, he found a band of villagers laughing and dancing, their mugs of ale lifted high.  </p>
<p><strong>3.17</strong> Seeing his dour face, the villagers called him over, saying, <em>“Friend, join us! For Apsu does not forbid the laughter of his followers; he invites it!”</em>  </p>
<p><strong>3.18</strong> When he asked how they could be so sure, one replied, <em>“Apsu gives us life in abundance, and his bounty is endless. If we do not laugh, we do not honor his joy. When we drink, it is not to dull our minds, but to lift our hearts.”</em>  </p>
<p><strong>3.19</strong> And in that moment, the Outreach understood that Apsu’s way was one of balance—of justice, yes, but also of joy. For even in the long journey, there is time for rest and cheer.  </p>
<p><strong>3.20</strong> And the elder said to Chitgu and Thuryo, “Let your hearts be merry, children. In each sip of ale and in each laugh, Apsu is honored. For the weary must find joy, lest they become the very darkness they hunt.”</p>
<h3 id="the-naming-of-cyron-and-cyrin">The Naming of Cyron and Cyrin</h3>
<p><strong>3.21</strong> Many years passed in the Cloister, and Chitgu and Thuryo grew strong in mind and body. Chitgu, the bold orc with arms of iron and a heart forged by loss, became a fierce warrior. Thuryo, the child of the doorstep, became a wizard of sharp wit and boundless knowledge. Together they learned of compassion and justice, of strength and mercy.</p>
<p><strong>3.22</strong> And on the Day of Outreach, the two knelt side by side, their faces reflecting the light of the dawn. The elder placed his hands upon their heads, blessing them in the name of Apsu, the First Dragon.  </p>
<p><strong>3.23</strong> And he spoke, <em>“By the grace of Apsu, who calls us all to the road, I name you Cyron and Cyrin. Go forth as an Outreach, with strength and wisdom bound as one.”</em>  </p>
<p><strong>3.24</strong> With these names, Cyron and Cyrin rose, no longer mere children of the Cloister but true followers of Apsu. As they set forth, the Cloister’s gates opened wide, and with the first light of dawn upon them, they knew that every lesson, every tale, was now theirs to carry into the world.</p>
<p><strong>3.25</strong> For Apsu’s path was not just theirs to follow but to write anew with each step.</p>
