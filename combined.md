1.1 In the time before time, when the void stretched endlessly and silence was the only sound, there emerged the First Dragon, Apsu. His presence brought both motion and meaning to the emptiness. His breath became the seed of life, swirling into winds that would traverse every corner of creation. His wings, vast as the infinite heavens, beat with a rhythm that shaped the currents of air and carried the essence of freedom into the very fabric of the world.

1.2 With a roar that shattered the eternal stillness, Apsu announced the arrival of the first dawn. His voice, imbued with the resonance of creation, awakened the sleeping potential of the void. As his flames brushed the barren peaks, they ignited a warmth that filled the earth with vitality. The mountains, once cold and silent, became the sanctuaries of life, and the first rivers began their descent, carrying his spirit through the land. Apsu’s gift was the Path, an invitation for all who would walk, soar, or sail upon it to partake in the boundless possibilities of existence.

1.3 Blessed is Apsu, the eternal guide who speaks to the hearts of the restless and the daring. His voice is the whisper of the wind through the trees, urging the hesitant to rise and explore. To the young, his call comes in the quiet of their dreams, painting visions of the horizon where earth meets sky. To the old, he sends winds that stir the ashes of forgotten ambitions, reigniting the spirit of adventure. He is the guardian of every step, the guide of every flight, and the unseen force behind every sail.

1.4 Apsu spoke to his followers, saying, “Children of breath and sky, you are heirs to my journey. Lift your eyes to the horizon and let your spirits take flight. The world I have woven is a tapestry of endless paths, each waiting for your tread. As I walked the empty void to shape this existence, so too shall I walk beside you, from the birth of the day to the quiet descent of night.”

1.5 The children of Apsu, often untried and seeking purpose, are drawn to the holy refuge known as the Cloister. This sanctuary is a crucible, where wanderers and dreamers are shaped by the teachings of the First Dragon. Yet the Cloister is no permanent dwelling, for Apsu is a god of movement and change. Its halls are adorned with symbols of the eternal journey—sacred rugs marked by the steps of countless pilgrims, the Eternal Flame of Journey burning at its heart, and the walls etched with the stories of those who came before.

1.6 The Cloister’s teachings encompass both the rigidity of law and the freedom of change. Here, the faithful learn the Way of the Wings, a balance between the discipline of tradition and the chaos of innovation. They are taught that Apsu’s will flows like a river, steady yet ever-changing, carving its path through the world. Discipline tempers their strength, compassion softens their resolve, and the songs of the Wanderers instill a reverence for the untamed world.

1.7 Students delve into the ancient histories of Apsu, study the virtues of Wind’s Grace, Flame’s Truth, and Sky’s Vastness, and learn to wield these lessons as tools for survival and guardianship. They practice rituals of compassion and celebrate fellowship through the crafting of sacred rugs, each stitch a reminder of their shared journey.

1.8 Yet their time in the Cloister is but a prelude. For each soul who enters will one day be called to the wider world, to seek their destiny beyond its gates. Their path is one of uncertainty and promise, a test of their faith in Apsu’s guidance and the resilience of their spirit.

1.9 On the sacred Day of Outreach, pairs of disciples stand at the threshold of their journey, their hands joined in unity and purpose. The grand altar, adorned with glowing trails of Land Glider slime, serves as the site of this pivotal rite. It is here that each Outreach receives their holy name—a shared bond signifying their divine mission and eternal connection.

1.10 The elder, cloaked in the wisdom of countless generations, raises a staff carved with the images of winged dragons. With a voice resonating with authority and love, he declares the names of the pairs: Rhael and Rael, Destin and Desten, Cyron and Cyrin. Each name echoes with the duality of Apsu’s nature, distinct in form yet united in sound, mirroring the harmony of law and change.

1.11 The Outreach pairs are not merely companions; they are reflections of Apsu’s balance. Together, they embody the virtues of their god and carry the light of his teachings into the world. Their union is a testament to the power of collaboration, a symbol of strength found in shared purpose.

1.12 Before stepping into the unknown, each Outreach pair recites their vow:

	“By Apsu’s breath, we pledge to speak in truth and compassion.
By Apsu’s wings, we vow to wander, unbound and unyielding.
By Apsu’s heart, we promise to aid the lost and protect the weak.
By Apsu’s claw, we swear to strike at the roots of evil.”

1.13 Their voices rise together, resonating through the Cloister, as they complete their oath:

	“Through chaos and order, we will find our way.
In freedom and faith, our journey begins.
As one voice, one path, one purpose,
For Apsu, our guide, our father, our light.”

1.14 Thus blessed, they set forth into the world, their steps echoing the eternal beat of Apsu’s wings.

1.15 These sacred words are written as a beacon for all who follow the First Dragon:

	“When the void lay empty and the stars slept unkindled, Apsu soared. He touched the expanse with his breath and stirred it to life. Each flame he lit became a promise, each wind a call to the wanderer. His path is unending, his purpose unbroken.”

1.16 And Apsu declared: “Go forth, children of the skies, and let no shadow deter you. Seek the lost and guide them. Walk paths untrodden, for even in the labyrinth of uncertainty, my spirit goes before you.”

1.17 And so they journey, the faithful of Apsu, bearing his light and his name. They wander the endless paths, singing the songs of the First Dragon, until the horizon itself bows to their passage.

**2.1** When the children of Apsu go forth, they do so mounted upon the loyal slugs of the wild, mighty creatures whose slime trails light the way even in the darkest night. These giant riding slugs, with eyes wide and calm, mirror the patience and endurance of Apsu himself. For in their slow tread, they teach the followers the virtue of persistence and the strength found in unyielding pursuit.  
**2.2** These mounts, known as the “Gliders of the Night,” are sacred to the followers of Apsu. It is said that Apsu himself blessed the slugs, that they might carry his faithful to places unseen by the bold or hasty. And as the slug journeys, so does the follower—steadfast, unwavering, and ready to chase down evil wherever it may crawl.  
**2.3** For the way of Apsu is one of unending pursuit, and his followers take no rest when the scent of evil is upon the air. Evil is a shadow upon the world, and the Outreach is the flame that seeks it, unwavering and bright. As it is written:  
> *“Seek always the darkness where it lingers; let not evil fester in the corners, for even the smallest seed of malice grows into poison. Root it out, and where it grows, there you shall tread.”*

**2.4** The First Dragon teaches that there is no act too bold nor too wild when it comes to vanquishing evil. To confront it, followers must be prepared to walk the path between law and chaos, between order and disobedience. For what is immoral in one life may be righteous in another if done to tear down the workings of evil.  
**2.5** An Outreach must discern not between “moral” and “immoral” as others do, but between the just and the unjust, between the path of light and the shadow of malice. If it serves to dismantle the works of cruelty, then it is counted as good, and Apsu will bless their hands.  
**2.6** Yet, let it be known, the faithful are also merchants and craftsmen. They barter, trade, and engage in the pursuits of business and enterprise. For each coin earned, each bond of trade established, is a mark of their resourcefulness and independence on the path. An Outreach can be as much a journey of commerce as of justice.

**2.7** And though they walk in pairs, there are times, rare and wondrous, when Apsu calls for a third. This third walks in harmony with the pair, for they are known as the Gift of Three, a trinity of strength, wisdom, and willpower.  
**2.8** When a third joins the Outreach, it is often in times of great need or to face darkness so deep that two would not be enough. They are bound not by name alone but by the spirit of Apsu himself, for he walks as the fourth unseen in their company.  
**2.9** It is said, *“As two wings are for balance, so three are for strength. When the darkness is deep, the Gift of Three shall carry the light.”*

### The Names of the Faithful

**2.10** On the Day of Outreach, each pair receives a name that is phonetically bound, a symbolic thread that ties them to Apsu and to each other. These names echo in unity, a reminder that they are one purpose, even as they are two lives. Some of these traditional names are:  
> *Jorick and Joryk, Rhael and Rael, Destin and Desten, Sarrin and Sarryn, Meera and Mira, Sorra and Soora, Lyven and Liven, Torven and Thorven, Ellor and Elore, Kalys and Calis, Brynn and Brinn, Galen and Gallen, Morik and Morrick, Veera and Vira, and Cyron and Cyrin.*  
**2.11** Each name is chosen by the elder on the Day of Outreach, a day marked by fasting, reflection, and meditation. The new names are whispered to them as the sun rises, a gift to carry forth into the world, and a constant reminder of their purpose.

### The Call to Seek and Conquer

**2.12** When an Outreach sets forth, they are charged with a sacred goal. Each Outreach has its purpose: a mission whispered to them in their final blessing. Yet the faithful are taught that their path is not bound by this single aim. Wherever evil is found, the Outreach must act, even if it draws them far from their given task.  
**2.13** And Apsu himself commands, *“Let no dark deed be ignored, no creature of malice unchallenged. For you are my light, and where you go, the shadows shall flee.”*  
**2.14** This is the virtue of the unwavering path, for even as they walk towards a single goal, their eyes are open to all evils that lurk along the way. They shall turn neither left nor right from their path of justice, nor will they be swayed by distraction. But where evil rises, they shall go to meet it.  
**2.15** And Apsu speaks to them through each trial, saying, *“You are my storm against the night, the flame that travels unyielding, and where evil goes, you shall go in answer.”*

### Of the Many Cloisters

**2.16** Many are the Cloisters of Apsu, each a place of respite, learning, and quiet strength. From one coast to another, in hidden forests and upon mountaintops, the Cloisters serve as havens for the faithful.  
**2.17** Here, the young are brought, gathered in the embrace of Apsu’s servants, that they might be shaped and strengthened. Each Cloister is bound by the same teachings, yet each is distinct, like branches of the same tree that stretch toward different skies.  
**2.18** And so, the followers of Apsu travel from Cloister to Cloister, spreading the knowledge of their god, bringing light to dark places, and joining in the timeless dance of law and freedom, order and change.  
**2.19** And so it is written, that when the last light fades and their strength is spent, the followers of Apsu shall be carried by their slugs to the final rest, with the name of Apsu upon their lips and the warmth of the first dawn in their hearts.
