## Chapter V: The Outreach of Three

**5.1** In the Cloister of Emberhollow, three young followers grew together like vines upon a single tree. Rowan, a dwarf with the strength of stone; Lirien, an elf with sharp wit and graceful stride; and Orlen, a gnome whose boundless curiosity brought both wisdom and trouble. Their bond was unshakable, yet their path was uncharted.

**5.2** When the Day of Outreach came, the three knelt before the altar, their faces lit by the golden morning. Though it was rare for three to be called, the elders saw in them the will of Apsu. And so, they were named as one:

> *“By the grace of Apsu, who calls the faithful to the road, I name you Thira, Thyra, and Thyrra. Go forth as one, three lives bound by a single purpose, a flame thrice bright to light the way.”*

**5.3** From that day forward, they were no longer Rowan, Lirien, and Orlen. They were Thira, Thyra, and Thyrra, a single flame in three forms, bound by name and purpose.

### The Challenges of Three

**5.4** As they set forth, their journey began with unity, their steps falling in rhythm. Yet, as the days wore on, discord grew among them. Decisions became slow, debates sharp, and trust frayed beneath the weight of three wills.

**5.5** One evening, as they camped by a river, Thyra spoke in frustration: *“Why did Apsu send three when two might walk with harmony? We quarrel like crows over scraps.”*

**5.6** Thyrra, gazing into the fire, said, *“Perhaps we must learn why.”*

**5.7** The answer came in their next trial. They reached a narrow gorge where a young family clung to the edge of a crumbling bridge. The parents held their child, their strength fading as the ropes frayed beneath them.

**5.8** Thyrra held the bridge steady with her mighty hands, while Thyra leapt across, pulling the family to safety. Thira tied a new rope, reinforcing the bridge before it could collapse entirely. Together, they saved the family, each playing a vital role.

**5.9** As they rested afterward, Thyrra said, *“Now I see. Two hands cannot both lift and leap, nor tie and hold. Apsu calls three to do what two cannot.”*

**5.10** They nodded in agreement, understanding that while three voices could clash, their strength lay in their unity.


### The Parable of the Flame and the Chimney

**5.11** Not long after, they took shelter in an abandoned house, cold and damp. Thira tried to light a fire, but the smoke filled the room, choking them. Frustrated, Thyra suggested abandoning the house, but Thyrra insisted they try again.

**5.12** Exploring the house, they discovered a chimney clogged with debris. Working together, they cleared it, and when the fire burned clean and warm, Thira laughed: *“The flame needed a guide, not a prison!”*

**5.13** In that moment, they understood the **Parable of the Flame and the Chimney**: *“Three are like a chimney to guide the flame higher. Though your steps may be heavy, your light will burn brighter, your purpose stronger.”*

**5.14** With the fire warming them, their spirits rose, and they resolved to trust one another as a flame trusts its chimney.


### The Parable of Fish and Cheese

**5.15** On their journey, they came upon a village celebrating a festival, with tables laden with food. Among the dishes was fish baked with cheese, its aroma sharp and pungent.

**5.16** Thira, ever curious, took a bite and immediately fell ill, her stomach warring with itself. Thyrra and Thyra carried her to a healer, who shook her head knowingly: *“Fish and cheese are not meant to share a plate, young one.”*

**5.17** When Thira recovered, she said, *“I sought to try all things, but I see now that wisdom lies in restraint. Not all combinations are meant to be.”*

**5.18** The three laughed, and Thira’s misstep became a lesson they carried forward: *“Do not seek strength in foolish trials. Some combinations are not meant to be, for even the earth has its limits.”*



### The Parable of Acid Rain and Statues

**5.19** In another town, they found the villagers despairing over strange rains that dissolved the stone statues in their square. The Outreach studied the damage, trying to understand.

**5.20** Thira tested the rain, discovering its corrosive nature, while Thyra examined the statues and found them made of soft limestone. Thyrra, recalling the lessons of stonecraft, said, *“This stone is unfit for such rain. Let us teach them to build with stronger rock.”*

**5.21** Together, they guided the villagers to rebuild with granite, and when the rains came again, the new statues stood firm.

**5.22** From this, they learned the **Parable of Acid Rain and Statues**: *“Faith and strength must go hand in hand. Build with care, or your work will crumble.”*


### The Lesson of Complex State Feet

**5.23** One night, while resting at an inn, they noticed a traveler struggling with his boots, which were laden with straps, weights, and mechanisms. Thyrra asked, *“Why are your boots so complicated?”*

**5.24** The traveler sighed, saying, *“I sought boots for all terrains, but now I can barely lift my feet.”*

**5.25** The three shared a laugh, and Thyra said, *“Apsu teaches that simplicity is strength. Let your steps be light, or your burdens will weigh you down.”*

**5.26** From then on, they resolved to carry only what was needed, keeping their journey simple and their hearts free.


### The Beast of Shadows and the Need for Three

**5.27** Their greatest trial came when they encountered a beast of shadow that preyed upon travelers, sowing despair and division. The villagers warned that no two warriors had ever defeated it.

**5.28** The beast struck with cunning, its form shifting and dividing to confuse them. Thyrra’s strength held it at bay, but it overwhelmed her. Thyra’s spells weakened it, but she could not strike the final blow. Thira’s speed harried it, but alone she could not corner it.

**5.29** Together, they devised a plan: Thyrra stood firm as a bulwark, Thyra’s magic forced the beast into a trap, and Thira delivered the decisive blow. The shadow dissipated, defeated by their unity.

**5.30** As they rested, Thyrra recounted the **Parable of the Three-Winged Griffin**:

> *“A Griffin with one wing cannot fly. A Griffin with two wings may soar, but it cannot carry. A Griffin with three wings, strange and unwieldy, is yet stronger than all, for it balances itself in flight, lifting burdens others cannot.”*

**5.31** They saw now the wisdom of their number, understanding that three was not a burden, but a gift.

### The Return and Blessing

**5.32** When their journey ended, they returned to the Cloister as heroes. The elders welcomed them, saying, *“You have walked the path of three, heavy and bright. Apsu’s light shines upon you.”*

**5.33** And thus, the tale of Thira, Thyra, and Thyrra became a song sung in the Cloister, a beacon for all who would walk in threes.
