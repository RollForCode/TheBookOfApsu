## Chapter I: The Song and the Path

**1.1** In the beginning, before the world knew the breadth of the skies or the warmth of the sun, there was the First Dragon, whose name is Apsu. In his breath lay the life of all things, and from his wings came the winds that would carry the songs of journey and freedom.  
**1.2** His roar broke the first dawn, and his wings beat to stir the winds. His flame touched the peaks of the mountains and lit them as the first fires of life. Thus was his gift to the world: a path for all who would walk, soar, or sail upon it.  
**1.3** Blessed be Apsu, he who calls to the wanderers and the willing, who calls the young from slumber to see the wide, untamed horizon. Blessed be he who guides each footstep upon the earth and each wingbeat in the sky, that they may know the heights and depths of his creation.  
**1.4** And Apsu spoke unto his followers: “Children of the wind and sky, lift your heads and seek the horizon. For I have woven this world that your feet may tread it, and I will walk beside you, from the edge of morning to the shadows of evening.”

### The Cloister’s Call

**1.5** When the children of Apsu are found, wandering and untried, they are brought to the holy place known as the Cloister, where they learn the Way of the Wings and the mysteries of the Unbound Path. This is their home for a time, yet not a place to settle, for their god is not of stasis but of sacred movement.  
**1.6** Here they are taught to honor both the law that binds and the change that frees. For Apsu is neither bound nor unyielding; his will is a river that flows between order and chaos. Thus they learn discipline and compassion, kindness and strength, preparing for the journey that awaits.  
**1.7** In the Cloister, they are taught not only rites and rituals but also the histories of the First Dragon and the songs of the Wanderers who came before. They learn to keep the laws of compassion, to give aid to the weak, and to carry forth Apsu’s light.  
**1.8** Yet this is but the beginning, for those who live in the Cloister shall one day be called beyond its gates, to a path untamed and a world unknown.

### The Day of Outreach

**1.9** And on the Day of Outreach, each pair stands hand-in-hand, ready to receive the blessing of Apsu. They are brought to the grand altar within the Cloister and await the holy Naming of Outreach.  
**1.10** Before them stands the elder, who speaks with the voice of the Cloister’s wisdom. And each pair is given a name that binds them to one another and to Apsu, as one echo answers another, two in purpose but distinct in sound.  
**1.11** The elder raises his voice: “By the grace of Apsu, who made the first journey and called us to follow, I name you: Rhael and Rael, Destin and Desten, Sarrin and Sarryn.” Thus, each pair is given a shared name, spelled in difference yet spoken as one.  
**1.12** And they are now an Outreach—a pair of lives united, reflecting the duality of Apsu’s own path, the balance of law and change, freedom and duty. Each pair is given to the world as a blessing, a reminder that even as they walk in twos, they walk in the will of their god.

### The Oath of the Outreach

**1.13** Before they depart the Cloister, each Outreach recites the holy oath, their vow to Apsu and to each other:  

> *“By Apsu’s wings, I vow to wander,  
> By Apsu’s breath, I vow to speak in kindness,  
> By Apsu’s heart, I vow to offer help to the helpless,  
> By Apsu’s claw, I vow to defend the just.”*  

**1.14** And in the holy place, the air rings with their voices as they complete the vow:  

> *“Through law and change, my loyalty is bound.  
> In faith and freedom, my path is found.  
> We journey now, two souls as one,  
> For Apsu, our father, our travels begun.”*  

### The Guiding Passage of Apsu

**1.15** And these words are written in the holy texts for all followers of Apsu, that they might remember the journey of the First Dragon:  

> *“When the First Dragon set his gaze upon the empty expanse, he did not rest; he made the sky his own and soared. He touched each star as a lover and gave his breath to the dawn, filling all voids with light and life.”*  

**1.16** And Apsu spoke to his children, saying: *“Go forth, and do not remain idle, for life is an unending trail. Seek those in darkness, that you may shine for them as I have shone for you. Know that the path you take is the path I have laid, even in its twists and turns.”*  
**1.17** And thus they go, the followers of Apsu, the faithful of the First Dragon. They carry his words in their hearts and his light upon their path, wandering the wide world until they too are called home.
