Chapter I: The Song and the Path

The Creation of Breath and Wind

**1.1** In the time before time, when the void stretched endlessly and silence was the only sound, there emerged the First Dragon, Apsu. His presence brought both motion and meaning to the emptiness. His breath became the seed of life, swirling into winds that would traverse every corner of creation. His wings, vast as the infinite heavens, beat with a rhythm that shaped the currents of air and carried the essence of freedom into the very fabric of the world.

**1.2** With a roar that shattered the eternal stillness, Apsu announced the arrival of the first dawn. His voice, imbued with the resonance of creation, awakened the sleeping potential of the void. As his flames brushed the barren peaks, they ignited a warmth that filled the earth with vitality. The mountains, once cold and silent, became the sanctuaries of life, and the first rivers began their descent, carrying his spirit through the land. Apsu’s gift was the Path, an invitation for all who would walk, soar, or sail upon it to partake in the boundless possibilities of existence.

The Call to Wanderers

**1.3** Blessed is Apsu, the eternal guide who speaks to the hearts of the restless and the daring. His voice is the whisper of the wind through the trees, urging the hesitant to rise and explore. To the young, his call comes in the quiet of their dreams, painting visions of the horizon where earth meets sky. To the old, he sends winds that stir the ashes of forgotten ambitions, reigniting the spirit of adventure. He is the guardian of every step, the guide of every flight, and the unseen force behind every sail.

**1.4** Apsu spoke to his followers, saying, “Children of breath and sky, you are heirs to my journey. Lift your eyes to the horizon and let your spirits take flight. The world I have woven is a tapestry of endless paths, each waiting for your tread. As I walked the empty void to shape this existence, so too shall I walk beside you, from the birth of the day to the quiet descent of night.”

The Cloister’s Call

**1.5** The children of Apsu, often untried and seeking purpose, are drawn to the holy refuge known as the Cloister. This sanctuary is a crucible, where wanderers and dreamers are shaped by the teachings of the First Dragon. Yet the Cloister is no permanent dwelling, for Apsu is a god of movement and change. Its halls are adorned with symbols of the eternal journey—sacred rugs marked by the steps of countless pilgrims, the Eternal Flame of Journey burning at its heart, and the walls etched with the stories of those who came before.

**1.6** The Cloister’s teachings encompass both the rigidity of law and the freedom of change. Here, the faithful learn the Way of the Wings, a balance between the discipline of tradition and the chaos of innovation. They are taught that Apsu’s will flows like a river, steady yet ever-changing, carving its path through the world. Discipline tempers their strength, compassion softens their resolve, and the songs of the Wanderers instill a reverence for the untamed world.

**1.7** Students delve into the ancient histories of Apsu, study the virtues of Wind’s Grace, Flame’s Truth, and Sky’s Vastness, and learn to wield these lessons as tools for survival and guardianship. They practice rituals of compassion and celebrate fellowship through the crafting of sacred rugs, each stitch a reminder of their shared journey.

**1.8** Yet their time in the Cloister is but a prelude. For each soul who enters will one day be called to the wider world, to seek their destiny beyond its gates. Their path is one of uncertainty and promise, a test of their faith in Apsu’s guidance and the resilience of their spirit.

### The Day of Outreach

**1.9** On the sacred Day of Outreach, pairs of disciples stand at the threshold of their journey, their hands joined in unity and purpose. The grand altar, adorned with glowing trails of Land Glider slime, serves as the site of this pivotal rite. It is here that each Outreach receives their holy name—a shared bond signifying their divine mission and eternal connection.

**1.10** The elder, cloaked in the wisdom of countless generations, raises a staff carved with the images of winged dragons. With a voice resonating with authority and love, he declares the names of the pairs: Rhael and Rael, Destin and Desten, Cyron and Cyrin. Each name echoes with the duality of Apsu’s nature, distinct in form yet united in sound, mirroring the harmony of law and change.

**1.11** The Outreach pairs are not merely companions; they are reflections of Apsu’s balance. Together, they embody the virtues of their god and carry the light of his teachings into the world. Their union is a testament to the power of collaboration, a symbol of strength found in shared purpose.

### The Oath of the Outreach

**1.12** Before stepping into the unknown, each Outreach pair recites their vow:

	“By Apsu’s breath, we pledge to speak in truth and compassion.
    By Apsu’s wings, we vow to wander, unbound and unyielding.
    By Apsu’s heart, we promise to aid the lost and protect the weak.
    By Apsu’s claw, we swear to strike at the roots of evil.”

**1.13** Their voices rise together, resonating through the Cloister, as they complete their oath:

	“Through chaos and order, we will find our way.
    In freedom and faith, our journey begins.
    As one voice, one path, one purpose,
    For Apsu, our guide, our father, our light.”

**1.14** Thus blessed, they set forth into the world, their steps echoing the eternal beat of Apsu’s wings.

### The Guiding Passage of Apsu

**1.15** These sacred words are written as a beacon for all who follow the First Dragon:

	“When the void lay empty and the stars slept unkindled, Apsu soared. He touched the expanse with his breath and stirred it to life. Each flame he lit became a promise, each wind a call to the wanderer. His path is unending, his purpose unbroken.”

**1.16** And Apsu declared: “Go forth, children of the skies, and let no shadow deter you. Seek the lost and guide them. Walk paths untrodden, for even in the labyrinth of uncertainty, my spirit goes before you.”

**1.17** And so they journey, the faithful of Apsu, bearing his light and his name. They wander the endless paths, singing the songs of the First Dragon, until the horizon itself bows to their passage.
