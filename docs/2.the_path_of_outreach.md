## Chapter II: The Path of Outreach and the Code of Apsu

**2.1** When the children of Apsu go forth, they do so mounted upon the loyal slugs of the wild, mighty creatures whose slime trails light the way even in the darkest night. These giant riding slugs, with eyes wide and calm, mirror the patience and endurance of Apsu himself. For in their slow tread, they teach the followers the virtue of persistence and the strength found in unyielding pursuit.  

**2.2** These mounts, known as the “Gliders of the Night,” are sacred to the followers of Apsu. It is said that Apsu himself blessed the slugs, that they might carry his faithful to places unseen by the bold or hasty. And as the slug journeys, so does the follower—steadfast, unwavering, and ready to chase down evil wherever it may crawl.

**2.3** For the way of Apsu is one of unending pursuit, and his followers take no rest when the scent of evil is upon the air. Evil is a shadow upon the world, and the Outreach is the flame that seeks it, unwavering and bright. As it is written:  
> *“Seek always the darkness where it lingers; let not evil fester in the corners, for even the smallest seed of malice grows into poison. Root it out, and where it grows, there you shall tread.”*

### The Unyielding Code of the Faithful

**2.4** The First Dragon teaches that there is no act too bold nor too wild when it comes to vanquishing evil. To confront it, followers must be prepared to walk the path between law and chaos, between order and disobedience. For what is immoral in one life may be righteous in another if done to tear down the workings of evil.  

**2.5** An Outreach must discern not between “moral” and “immoral” as others do, but between the just and the unjust, between the path of light and the shadow of malice. If it serves to dismantle the works of cruelty, then it is counted as good, and Apsu will bless their hands.  

**2.6** Yet, let it be known, the faithful are also merchants and craftsmen. They barter, trade, and engage in the pursuits of business and enterprise. For each coin earned, each bond of trade established, is a mark of their resourcefulness and independence on the path. An Outreach can be as much a journey of commerce as of justice.

### The Gift of Three

**2.7** And though they walk in pairs, there are times, rare and wondrous, when Apsu calls for a third. This third walks in harmony with the pair, for they are known as the Gift of Three, a trinity of strength, wisdom, and willpower.  

**2.8** When a third joins the Outreach, it is often in times of great need or to face darkness so deep that two would not be enough. They are bound not by name alone but by the spirit of Apsu himself, for he walks as the fourth unseen in their company.  

**2.9** It is said, *“As two wings are for balance, so three are for strength. When the darkness is deep, the Gift of Three shall carry the light.”*

### The Names of the Faithful

**2.10** On the Day of Outreach, each pair receives a name that is phonetically bound, a symbolic thread that ties them to Apsu and to each other. These names echo in unity, a reminder that they are one purpose, even as they are two lives. Some of these traditional names are:  
> *Jorick and Joryk, Rhael and Rael, Destin and Desten, Sarrin and Sarryn, Meera and Mira, Sorra and Soora, Lyven and Liven, Torven and Thorven, Ellor and Elore, Kalys and Calis, Brynn and Brinn, Galen and Gallen, Morik and Morrick, Veera and Vira, and Cyron and Cyrin.*  

**2.11** Each name is chosen by the elder on the Day of Outreach, a day marked by fasting, reflection, and meditation. The new names are whispered to them as the sun rises, a gift to carry forth into the world, and a constant reminder of their purpose.

### The Call to Seek and Conquer

**2.12** When an Outreach sets forth, they are charged with a sacred goal. Each Outreach has its purpose: a mission whispered to them in their final blessing. Yet the faithful are taught that their path is not bound by this single aim. Wherever evil is found, the Outreach must act, even if it draws them far from their given task.  

**2.13** And Apsu himself commands, *“Let no dark deed be ignored, no creature of malice unchallenged. For you are my light, and where you go, the shadows shall flee.”*  

**2.14** This is the virtue of the unwavering path, for even as they walk towards a single goal, their eyes are open to all evils that lurk along the way. They shall turn neither left nor right from their path of justice, nor will they be swayed by distraction. But where evil rises, they shall go to meet it.  

**2.15** And Apsu speaks to them through each trial, saying, *“You are my storm against the night, the flame that travels unyielding, and where evil goes, you shall go in answer.”*

### Of the Many Cloisters

**2.16** Many are the Cloisters of Apsu, each a place of respite, learning, and quiet strength. From one coast to another, in hidden forests and upon mountaintops, the Cloisters serve as havens for the faithful.  

**2.17** Here, the young are brought, gathered in the embrace of Apsu’s servants, that they might be shaped and strengthened. Each Cloister is bound by the same teachings, yet each is distinct, like branches of the same tree that stretch toward different skies.  

**2.18** And so, the followers of Apsu travel from Cloister to Cloister, spreading the knowledge of their god, bringing light to dark places, and joining in the timeless dance of law and freedom, order and change.  

**2.19** And so it is written, that when the last light fades and their strength is spent, the followers of Apsu shall be carried by their slugs to the final rest, with the name of Apsu upon their lips and the warmth of the first dawn in their hearts.
